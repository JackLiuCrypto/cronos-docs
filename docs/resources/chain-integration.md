#### RPC URLs for Cronos mainnet Beta

:::danger Public RPCs URL Updates: The Cronos RPC endpoints have been lately updated (shown as below) and it is recommended for users to update the endpoints. The old endpoints are still available for compatibility but maybe deprecated later. :::

:::tip Request Limits on Public RPCs: To provide a stable experience to users, there is a request rate limit on the public RPCs to ensure fair usage. If your application requires a higher usage, please consider setting up your own nodes. You can also reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cGtxgVfGMZ) for assistance. :::

:::tip Public RPCs Integration Tips: There are more than one machines serving the public RPC services. There is no guarantee that you are served by the same machine every time. This could break the assumptions of some applications. For example when you want to broadcast multiple transactions in sequential account nonce at once, each transactions may arrive on different machines if you are not broadcasting them in a batch.

If this assumption is important in your application, please consider setting up your own nodes. :::

#### Creating API Keys on CronoScan

The CronoScan Developer APIs are designed to provide accessible and consistent Cronos data to the Cronos community. The APIs are provided as a community service with a rate up to 5 calls per second per IP. Users need to [register](https://cronoscan.com/register) for a CronoScan account to create an API key. After registration, a CronoScan user account will have a quota of up to 3 API keys.

On the [CronoScan user dashboard](https://cronoscan.com/myaccount), select “_**API-KEYs**_” from the left-hand side column or go to [https://cronoscan.com/myapikey](https://cronoscan.com/myapikey).

Click on the “_**Create a new API-KEY token**_” button, then optionally input an “_**AppName**_”, “My Cronos App” for example.

After the “_**API-KEY Token**_” is successfully created, a message will show up as below, and you may now use the “_**API key token**_” for your applications on Cronos!
